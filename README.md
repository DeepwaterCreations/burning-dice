Burning Dice
============
by Deepwater Creations 

This is an Android die roller app for the Burning Wheel family of tabletop RPGs. Partly this project is meant to teach me about Android programming, but I also think it would be nice if there were a die roller for this family of RPGs, since they have somewhat quirky die rolling mechanics. Generic die rollers can be used, but a Burning Wheel-specific die roller would be considerably more useful to account for some of those quirks.

When the app is finished, the user should be able to: 
<ul>
<li>Specify a number and shade of dice (DONE)</li>
<li>Specify if a roll is open-ended (DONE)</li>
<li>Receive a number of successes generated, as well as the individual die results (DONE)</li>
<li>Display results in a manner that is graphically pleasing (IN PROGRESS)</li>
<li>Optionally specify an obstacle and receive information about whether the roll
was successful and what kind of test was earned (DONE)</li>
<li>Specify which dice come from Artha, as well as other die sources (advantage, FoRKs, working carefully, help) (DONE)</li>
<li>Spend Fate and Deeds points after the roll results are generated to open the roll or reroll failures (DONE)</li>
<li>Specify Versus or Graduated tests</li>
<li>Specify Beginner's Luck tests and receive accurate information about the test earned</li> (DONE)
<li>Nice-looking graphics with custom button images and so-forth</li>
<li>Review a log of recent rolls, possibly with notes about what the roll was for</li>
<li>Roll dice in a way that is graphically interesting and fun</li>
<li>Network with other app users to broadcast roll results between multiple smartphones</li>
<li>Receive/offer helping dice over said network and get accurate information about tests earned via help</li>
<li>Customize die colors</li>
<li>See helping dice in the helper's color, so we can see if they were helpful or not</li>
<li>Re-skin dice for Burning Wheel, Burning Empires, Mouse Guard and Torchbearer (and maybe The Blossoms are Falling and Jihad and Under A Serpent Sun...?)</li>
<li>Make Astrology rolls and have them be properly handled</li>
</ul>

That's roughly the order I plan to implement this stuff in. I don't promise I'll get to everything! My plan is maybe to release it when I get the basic rolling functionality working, and add on the more advanced stuff (graphics, networking) later. 

The Burning Wheel RPG is not my creation. It belongs to Luke Crane, and you can find out more about it at http://www.burningwheel.org/<br>
